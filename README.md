# mVAM dashboard 

This is a follow-up project to create a functional dashboard for the World Food Programme (WFP) mVAM Food Security Monitoring data, based on a hackathon organised by [DataMission](http://www.datamission.nl).

Documentation of the code is inline in the files and in the /docs/ folder (build with sphinx) for view online [here](http://mvammaps.readthedocs.io)
